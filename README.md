Have lived and worked all over the world for the last 20 years and am recently returned from travelling in Colombia and the USA. I'm looking to join a team in London where I can learn and grow as a software developer, as well as be actively involved in the product. Curious about all forms of technology, from raspberry pi to iOS. Interested in media, politics, journalism and education.


## Recent Projects

The first time most of us had worked on a mobile application.|React Native, Expo, Jest, Enzyme|
|[Acebook](https://github.com/jdm79/acebook-PingPongAlmonds)| 11 days| Second group project, Facebook clone built using Agile methodologies.

|[Makers BnB](https://github.com/jdm79/makersbnb)| 5 days| This was the first ever group project that any of us had done. The task was to create a platform which emulates the functionality of Airbnb.

|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/jdm79/bank-tech-test-ruby)| 2 days| TDD Ruby mock tech test where the intention was to produce high quality, flexible, easy-to-understand, and maintainable code. |Ruby, RSpec|

One project I am keen to begin is an app listing gluten-free (or gluten-free friendly) places in the user's vicinity, using geolocation.


## Skills

#### Collaborative

The past few months have emphasised how powerful effective teamwork can be, and how crucial communication is for achieving this. The group projects listed above have given me a taste of working in software teams, helping me to become more comfortable with Agile methodologies and sparking a desire to continue building things in the future, whatever the tech stack.

#### Experienced

Having lived, studied and worked in four different countries over the last 20 years, in a wide variety of careers, I feel like I have much to offer as an employee and a team member in terms of experience, people skills and learning new technologies, in addition to having a greater understanding of the world context.
