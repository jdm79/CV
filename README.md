Since finishing university I have been learning to code and I have recently finished 16 weeks at one of the U.K.'s most sought-after coding boot camps, learning full-stack web development & Agile methodologies. I am looking for a position in a forward-thinking environment, that values continuous learning, collaboration & innovation. I have always had a keen interest in finance - actively investing in stocks since 18 - and would relish the opportunity to work somewhere that allows me to build on these, my two main interests.


## Recent Projects

| Project | Timeframe | Description | Technologies |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
|[Injection Dependent](https://github.com/Alastair2D/injection_dependent)|11 days|Final group project. To help those recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, by i) keeping a record of previous injections, and ii) suggesting the next injection site to help make cycling through them habitual. The first time any of us had worked on a mobile application.|React Native, Expo, Jest, Enzyme|
|[Acebook](https://github.com/hjpugh/acebook-PingPongAlmonds)| 11 days| Second group project, Facebook clone built using Agile methodologies. Initially all done in Rails, halfway through we were told to separate the front & back-end. This was very useful in teaching the basics of developing a RESTful API, and also built on what I'd been doing in React before.| Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Devise, JavaScript, React, Jest, Enzyme
|[Makers BnB](https://github.com/hjpugh/makersbnb)| 5 days| This was the first ever group project that any of us had done. The task was to create a platform which emulates the functionality of Airbnb. It taught us a lot about best practices when it comes to working in a group.| Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec, PostgreSQL, Active Record
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/hjpugh/bank-tech-test-java)| 2 days| First ever experience with Java, mock tech test where the intention was to produce high quality, easy to understand, maintainable code. |Java, Junit Gradle|

One project I am keen to resume work on is an automated spread betting bot.

## Skills

#### Analytical

My entire educational background has always been heavily based in science and maths. Beyond education, actively investing has taught me a lot regarding the world of finance. I check the markets on a daily basis, and this is a primary interest of mine.

#### Collaborative

The past few months have emphasised how powerful effective teamwork can be, and how crucial communication is for achieving this. I think the group projects listed above attest to my improment over the course, becoming more comfortable with Agile methodologies.

#### Fast Learner

I thoroughly enjoy taking on the challenge of learning something new and I am always incredibly self-motivated to do so. My approach to learning has been improved through college and university, and more recently at Maker's Academy. This experience has given me great confidence in taking on anything new. e.g. Bank Tech Test - test driven in two days and passed all stated criteria, despite having never done anything in Java before.

## Education

#### [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (August 2018 - November 2018)

A 16 week intensive coding course, which includes the following:

- Object Oriented Programming - using SOLID principles to write clean code.
- Test Driven Development.
- Pair programming, and group work in teams of 4-5 using Agile methodologies & Extreme programming practices.
- Heavy focus on self-led learning & self reflection, as to improve processes.
- Full-stack web development: JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Rails, React, node.js, RSpec, Jasmine, JUnit, Gradle, Enzyme, Capybara, Selenium, jQuery, PostgreSQL, MVC etc.

In addition to the work done here, I have also experimented in Python, C++ and more recently in Java and Go.

#### University of Leeds (2014 - 2017)
##### BSc Economics (2:1)

- Keen interest in behavioural economics, based on the fundamentals of human psychology.
- Big focus on statistical techniques and econometric techniques e.g. linear-regression statistics, spotting general trends and relationships, indentifying sources of potential error.
- Built on prior knowledge regarding the world of finance.
- Many of my most enjoyable modules were those with a heavy emphasis on maths and data analysis.

#### MPW Cambridge
##### A Levels

- Economics - A\*
- Mathematics - A
- Physics - A
- AS Further Mathematics

## Experience

**First Direct** (September 2017 - July 2018)  
 _Sales & Service Representative_
 
Working here was really useful as I would not have said I have a natural aptitude for many of the skills required before starting, however by working hard I was able to perform at a level where I was being recognised. Working here taught me brilliant communication skills and a great deal about the world of retail banking.
